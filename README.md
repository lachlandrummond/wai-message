# Wai-Message
Private messaging system for a school project using PHP and MySQL.

### Setup
Apache Web Server with MySQL and PHPMyAdmin, or I used WAMP on my PC which comes with both.
Import the database.sql file  into a blank database with PHPMyAdmin, it should fully duplicate my database but without data.
Edit inc/db-connect.php so that 'YOUR_PHPMYADMIN_USERNAME', 'YOUR_PHPMYADMIN_PASSWORD', 'YOUR_PHPMYADMIN_DATABASE' are no longer placeholders.
Voila.
